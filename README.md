## Aceleradev React - Codenation 2019

AceleraDev is an acceleration program for devs supported by technology companies and facilitated by [Codenation] (https://www.codenation.dev/), focusing on the training of potential Brazilian talent to work in the area of software development. 

The acceleration that I chose to participate in and was also accepted was React's acceleration.

This project was created to keep documented everything that happened during the acceleration, from the links of articles and content, to the challenges requested in each step.

Hope you enjoy it, because I'm particularly enjoying it !!!

So let's code = D
